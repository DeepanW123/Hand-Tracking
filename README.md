# Hand-Tracking
 Playing around with OpenCV and MediaPipe to create something fun

# Current Utilities:
 - Press Q to quit the program
 - Press Z to go into zoom mode:
    - If you only use one hand, the zoom is based on the distance between your thumb and the index finger, and the focal point is at the midpoint of the two.
    - If you use two hands, the left controls the zoom and the right controls the zoom's intensity
